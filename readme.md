# Title here

This website is fully done in plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no server side language. It's supposed to be an easy template to add new pages to.

## Testing

To test locally you can either put this folder in an apache server or you can run a development server with the `http.server` python module (`python -m http.server PORT`) or with PHP (`php -S 0.0.0.0:PORT`)

## Development

To format the code it is recommended to run `npm run format` as this will use Prettier and the configuration set in `package.json` to format all the code in this repo.
